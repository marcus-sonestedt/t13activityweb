## Data model

* EventTypes - race day, training week, track work day or club barbecues
* Events - a specific race or similar time-bound event of some type
* ActivityType - a role that has to be filled during an event, flag marshal, pre-grid controller or technical scrutineer for races, carpenter or painter for work days or grill-meister and sauce-master for barbecues.
* Activity - a specific activity of given type for an event, which can be assigned to a user
* Member - person able to perform an Activity, possible linked to a web site User
* ActivityDelistRequest - request by member to be de-listed from an activity, must be approved/rejected by staff to have an effect, unless someone else
books that activity

## Development

* Any OS should work, although it has been developed on Windows with the goal to support running on Linux in production.
* Visual Studio Code is an free and excellent editor.
* Visual Studio Community/Professional is also usable.

### Architecture Overview

This project was set-up with inspiration from [this blog](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/drf/) but using  Typescript instead of Javascript for the React frontend for type safety.

Currently, the React-based frontend is served via the Django web server but it could be moved to a fast, static website/CDN in the future.

The end-user part of the front-end is written in React to
work as a single-page web application, putting most of the
work on the client and leaving the server with only delivering
data and answering terse api-calls.

For administrators, a classic render-html-on-server approach
via the regular Django framework is used, mostly because we
want to use Django's great autogenerated admin-site to enter
and adjust the backing data

### Backend

Uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) & [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

By default, uses the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) db during development, which runs in-process against a single file.

* Install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org) or later

* Create a virtual python environment and activate it

  * On Windows:

    ```cmd/bat
    python -m venv env  
    env/scripts/activate.bat
    ```

    ```powershell
    python -m venv env  
    env/scripts/activate.ps1

  * On Linux:

    ```bash
    virtualenv env
    source env/scripts/activate
    ```

* Install required packages (into the virtual environment)  
  This must be done whenever requirements.txt is updated)

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Collect static files

'''bash
python manage.py collectstatic

* Initialize database with create schema (via migrations), load some sample data and create a super user so you can log in:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/2020_testdata.json --format=json
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

* Start development server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### FrontEnd

Uses [React](https://reactjs.org), TypeScript and Bootstrap.

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

* Go into frontend dir

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  ```

* Install packages:  
  This must be done whenever frontend/packages.json is updated.

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

* Start development server

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

## Setup running in production

* Perform steps for backend & frontend above except starting servers
* In repo root, run the build.py script:  

  ```bash
  python ./build.py
  ```

  This builds the frontend and copies static files to where Django expects them.

* Setup the Django site as a WSGI app on your web host:

    ```python
    import os
    import sys

    # assuming your django settings file is at '/home/macke/t13activityweb/T13ActivityWeb/settings.py'
    # and your manage.py is is at '/home/macke/t13activityweb/manage.py'
    path = '/home/macke/t13activityweb'
    if path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(path)

    os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'T13ActivityWeb.settings'

    # then:
    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
    application = get_wsgi_application()
    ```

* Start your server!

### Tweak stuff via SQL! (danger)

Set tasks' earliest bookable date 1 month before event occurs, for events at a certain date or later

(This is different for every SQL DB apparently, see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1293330/how-can-i-do-an-update-statement-with-join-in-sql-server#1293347)

Code below is for SQLite (run sqlite3 in prompt, or google for a GUI)

```sql
update app_activity
set earliest_bookable_date = (
  select date(e.start_date, "-1 months") 
  from app_event e 
  where e.id = event_id
)
where ROWID in (
  select a.ROWID from app_activity a
  left join app_event e on a.event_id = e.id
  where e.start_date >= '2024-07-01' 
);
```

## Update individual packages

### Frontend/NPM

Check outdated packages

```bash
npm outdated
```

Then update (save/save-dev depending if used during runtime or not)

```bash
npm install <package>@latest --save[-dev]
```

### Backend/PIP

List outdated packages:

```bash
python -m pip list --outdated
```

Update via [pipupgrade](https://github.com/achillesrasquinha/pipupgrade),
or any another method recommended [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2720014/how-to-upgrade-all-python-packages-with-pip).

```bash
python -m pip install pipupgrade
python -m pipupgrade --latest --yes
```

## Third-party services

API-Keys, passwords, email-addresses and other things that interact with the world
outside this web application is stored in secrets.py.

See [secrets_example.py](T13ActivityWeb\secrets_example.py) for the format and current keys.

The app _should_ work fine without this file or with a subset of keys, please report a bug if
your experience is different.

### ReCaptcha v3

Purpose:

* Verify that users registering and/or logging in are humans

Setup:

* Get the two keys from [Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/).
* Add these to secrets.py

Usage:

* Website uses the django-recaptcha library to integrate into login/register forms.  
  The forms have a ReCaptcha field and the require

### Twilio

Purpose:

* send/receive SMS.
* verifying phone numbers (via SMS)

Setup:

* Create phone number (for SMS source) and get api keys from their [Admin Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/).

* Create a messaging service and configure webhook to point to our server's 'api/sms' view to receive SMS.

Usage:

* Web site uses Twilio's python library to send SMS and verify phone numbers.

### Sendgrid (by Twilio)

Purpose:

* Send lots of emails.

Setup:

* Get API key from [Admin Console](https://app.sendgrid.com/).

Usage:

* Web site uses Sendgrid's SMTP relay to use Django's existing email code easily.
