### Architecture Overview

This project was set-up with inspiration from [this blog](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/drf/) but using  Typescript instead of Javascript for the React frontend for type safety.

Currently, the React-based frontend is served via the Django web server but it could be moved to a fast, static website/CDN in the future.

The end-user part of the front-end is written in React to
work as a single-page web application, putting most of the
work on the client and leaving the server with only delivering
data and answering terse api-calls.

For administrators, a classic render-html-on-server approach
via the regular Django framework is used, mostly because we
want to use Django's great autogenerated admin-site to enter
and adjust the backing data

### FrontEnd

Uses [React](https://reactjs.org), TypeScript and Bootstrap.

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* Install packages:

```bash
npm install
```

* Start development server
```
npm start
```

### Backend

Uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) & [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

By default, uses the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) db during development, which runs in-process against a single file.

* Install [Python](https://www.python.org)

* Create and activate a virtual python environment
```bash
python -m venv env
env/scripts/activate
```

* Instlal packages
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Init database, apply any new migrations and populate tables
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata testdata
```

* Start development server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
