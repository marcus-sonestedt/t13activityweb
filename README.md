## Data model

* EventTypes - race day, training week, track work day or club barbequeue
* Events - a specific race or similar time-bound event of some type
* ActivityType - a role that has to be filled during an event, flag marshal, pre-grid controller or technical scrutineer for races, carpenter or painter for work days or grillmeister and saucemaster for barbequeues.
* Activity - a specific activity of given type for an event, which can be assigned to a user
* Member - person able to perform an Activity, possible linked to a web site User

## Development

* Any OS should work, although it has been devleoped on Windows with the goal to support running on Linux in production.
* Visual Studio Code is an free and excellent editor.
* Visual Studio Community/Professional is also usable.

### Architecture Overview

This project was set-up with inspiration from [this blog](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/drf/) but using  Typescript instead of Javascript for the React frontend for type safety.

Currently, the React-based frontend is served via the Django web server but it could be moved to a fast, static website/CDN in the future.

The end-user part of the front-end is written in React to
work as a single-page web application, putting most of the
work on the client and leaving the server with only delivering
data and answering terse api-calls.

For administrators, a classic render-html-on-server approach
via the regular Django framework is used, mostly because we
want to use Django's great autogenerated admin-site to enter
and adjust the backing data

### Backend

Uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) & [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

By default, uses the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) db during development, which runs in-process against a single file.

* Install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org) or later

* Create a virtual python environment

```bash
python -m venv env
```

* Activate it:

 * On Windows:

```cmd
env/scripts/activate
```

 * On Linux:

```bash
source env/scripts/activate
```

* Install required packages (into the virtual evnironment)

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Init database, apply any new migrations and populate tables

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata testdata
```

* Start development server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### FrontEnd

Uses [React](https://reactjs.org), TypeScript and Bootstrap.

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* Install packages:

```bash
npm install
```

* Start development server

```
npm start
```

## Deploying to production

* Perform steps for backend & frontend above except starting servers
* In repo root, run the build.py script:

```bash
python ./build.py
```

Or in ~/frontend/:

```bash
npm run build
```

* Setup the Django site as a WSGI app:

```python
import os
import sys

# assuming your django settings file is at '/home/macke/t13activityweb/T13ActivityWeb/settings.py'
# and your manage.py is is at '/home/macke/t13activityweb/manage.py'
path = '/home/macke/t13activityweb'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(path)

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'T13ActivityWeb.settings'

# then:
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
application = get_wsgi_application()
```

## Update packages

### frontend

Check outdated packages

```bash
npm outdated
```

Then update (save/save-dev depending if used during runtime or not)

```bash
npm install <package>@latest --save[-dev]
```

### Backend

```bash
pip
```
